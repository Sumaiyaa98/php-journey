//echo can work as a function as well


//variables in php
// just like in other languages, variables are also similar in php as well
// but we don't have to declare the type of the variable that we do in c++ and other lng, we can directly declare them by using $ sign

//ex
echo "<br>Variables in PHP<br>";
$name = "Carlos";
echo $name;


?>

<?php
//we can also write html in php too
// for that we just have to add the html tags inside the echo of php tags
//ex
//heading of html in php
echo "<h1>Php with html</h1>";
echo "<h2 style='color:purple'>Colorful text using html styling</h2>";


//using html tags for php variables
$myText = "hello world";
echo "<h3>$myText</h3>";

?>

<h1>

<!-- php tags inside html ones -->
 <?php

 echo "heyy"
 ?>
</h1>
