//echo can work as a function as well


//variables in php
// just like in other languages, variables are also similar in php as well
// but we don't have to declare the type of the variable that we do in c++ and other lng, we can directly declare them by using $ sign

//ex
echo "<br>Variables in PHP<br>";
$name = "Carlos";
echo $name;
